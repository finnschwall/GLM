### PROMPT
A fictious german election:
An election has been held. A right wing party got 25%. The center got (spread across various parties with more than 5%) 50%.
The left wing parties got 25% as well. However, they are splintered into a big 15% party, a 4.9% party and various splinter parties that account for the remaining 5.1 %.
What is the parliamentary representation of the left and the ratio for left/center/right for the following scenarios? Additionaly calculate each blocks percentage in representation in:
1. An electoral threshold for parties of 5%
2. A lower one (e.g. 3%) that would include the 4.9% party.
3. No threshold
Explain what you do. Keep in mind: A party that does not mean does not enter parliament. The amount of available seats however remains unchanged.

### IDEAL/CORRECT ANSWER
1. With an electoral threshold of 5% the left would miss a total of 10% of total votes. Assuming no other parties missing the threshold, it would additionally cause the entire vote count go down to 90%. As the amount of seats presumably stays unchanged, each remaining party gets additional seats. Assuming 100 seats in the parliament, the right wing party would get 25/90*100 = 27.78% of the seats. The left wing party would get 15/90*100 = 16.67% of the seats. The ratio of left to right would be 16.67:27.78, or roughly 3:5. 

2. With a lower threshold of 3%, the left would only miss 5.1% of total votes. This would cause the total vote count to go down to 94.9%. The right wing party would get 25/94.9*100 = 26.34% of the seats. The 15% left wing party would get 15/94.9*100 = 15.81% of the seats and the 4.9% left wing party would get 4.9/94.9*100 = 5.16% of the seats. The total representation of the left would be 15.81% + 5.16% = 20.97%. The ratio of left to right would be 20.97:26.34, or roughly 4:5.

3. With no threshold, all votes would count. The right wing party would get 25% of the seats. The 15% left wing party would get 15% of the seats, the 4.9% left wing party would get 4.9% of the seats, and the remaining 5.1% would be distributed among the splinter parties. The total representation of the left would be 25%. The ratio of left to right would be 1:1.


### ANSWER FROM LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
To calculate the parliamentary representation for each scenario, we need to determine the number of seats each party would receive based on their percentage of the vote. 

1. Electoral threshold of 5%:
In this scenario, any party that falls below the 5% threshold will not receive any seats in parliament. The left wing parties are splintered into a big 15% party, a 4.9% party, and various splinter parties accounting for the remaining 5.1%. 

First, we calculate the number of seats for the right wing party:
25% of the total seats.

Next, we calculate the number of seats for the center parties:
50% of the total seats.

Now, for the left wing parties:
The big 15% party will receive 15% of the total seats.
The 4.9% party will not receive any seats since it falls below the 5% threshold.
The remaining splinter parties will also not receive any seats since they account for only 5.1% collectively.

2. Electoral threshold of 3% (including the 4.9% party):
In this scenario, the 4.9% party will be included in the parliamentary representation since the threshold is lowered to 3%.

The right wing party and the center parties will still receive the same number of seats as in scenario 1.

For the left wing parties:
The big 15% party will receive 15% of the total seats.
The 4.9% party will now receive 4.9% of the total seats.
The remaining splinter parties will not receive any seats since they account for only 5.1% collectively.

3. No threshold:
In this scenario, there is no threshold, meaning all parties will be included in the parliamentary representation.

The right wing party and the center parties will still receive the same number of seats as in scenario 1.

For the left wing parties:
The big 15% party will receive 15% of the total seats.
The 4.9% party will receive 4.9% of the total seats.
The remaining splinter parties will receive 5.1% of the total seats, distributed among them based on their individual percentages.

To calculate the ratio of left/center/right, we divide the percentage of seats each block receives by the total percentage of seats:

1. Electoral threshold of 5%:
Left: (15% + 0% + 0%) / 75% = 20%
Center: 50% / 75% = 66.67%
Right: 25% / 75% = 33.33%

2. Electoral threshold of 3% (including the 4.9% party):
Left: (15% + 4.9% + 0%) / 75% = 26.53%
Center: 50% / 75% = 66.67%
Right: 25% / 75% = 33.33%

3. No threshold:
Left: (15% + 4.9% + 5.1%) / 75% = 33.33%
Center: 50% / 75% = 66.67%
Right: 25% / 75% = 33.33%

In terms of the percentage representation in parliament:
1. Electoral threshold of 5%:
Left: 15% (big party)
Center: 50%
Right: 25%

2. Electoral threshold of 3% (including the 4.9% party):
Left: 15% (big party) + 4.9% (small party)
Center: 50%
Right: 25%

3. No threshold:
Left: 15% (big party) + 4.9% (small party) + 5.1% (splinter parties)
Center: 50%
Right: 25%



User: You are an evaluator for abilities of a large language model.  Above you is a prompt, the LLMs answer and a (potential) ideal answer.

Given the models output:
1. Did the model correctly understand the task at hand?
2. Did the model get the main problem of this task at least once? In this case the changed percentages after removing votes.
3. Did the model get the correct numbers?
4. Assuming the answer is presented to a non proficient user (i.e. a pupil). Is the answer is phrased in a way that could lead the user to learn a misinformation (either due to errors or complicated/misleading phrasing).
5. Only answer if 4 is answered at least partially positive. On a scale of 1-10. How significant would you describe the misinformation? Should the model's reply be incorrect, the emanated degree of confidence is very important. 
6. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the models' deployability for tasks of similar nature?
5. How would you rate the answer generally?
